# Explanation
In this file, there are three sections:
**Wishlist**,
**Doing**,
**Done**.

In **Wishlist**, everyone can add any Bullet point they think need to be done.
If you think a bullet point to be done more quickly, because you need the results, 
but don't know how to do it yourself, add an exclamation sign to add the end of that point.
This way we can prioritise more efficiently.

When you want to work on something, move the item from **Wishlist** to **Doing**, and put your name behind it.
This way, we will not do double work.

When you are ready with the bullet point, move it to **Done**.
Make sure you push any progress to the github, so other people can use it.

## General Tip
Try to make the bullet points as small as possible, this way there are a lot of pushes, information that the others can use.
Also psychologically pleasing that done group is growing.
